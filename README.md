# SOBA
Semi-automated Ontology Builder for Aspect-based sentiment analysis (SOBA)

This project contains the code for SOBA and the adjusted Two-Stage Hybrid Model (TSHM) by Schouten and Frasincar (2018). The TSHM is adapted so that it takes into account dictionary semantics.

Because of the large size of the data files, not all resources could be added to this GitHub project. Therefore, please go to .... and download the files in resources_data to SOBA/src/main/resources/data. Similarly, add the files in resources_externaldata to SOBA/src/main/resources/externaldata.

After this, to use the ontology builder SOBA, run the class MainOntoBuild.

To evaluate the SOBA ontologies in the TSHM, run the ESWC2018 class.
